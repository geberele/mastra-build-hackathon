# MASTRA.BUILD Virtual Hackathon

This repository contains my personal project for the MASTRA.BUILD Virtual Hackathon. Here I'll be developing and documenting my AI agent solution.

## Project Overview
This project implements an intelligent chatbot powered by Smithery and MCP that serves as a financial assistant for stock market information. The chatbot helps users access and understand stock market data through natural conversations, making financial information more accessible and easier to comprehend.

Key Features:
- Real-time stock market data retrieval and analysis
- Natural language processing for intuitive user interactions
- Personalized stock recommendations based on user preferences
- Historical data analysis and trend visualization
- Market news and updates integration

## Demo
